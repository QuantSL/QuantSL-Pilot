## generate\_`SYMBOLE`

Examples:
1.
  ```
  generate_H(; parameters::Dict)
  ```
  Generates the operator `H` according to the definition provided in the _qobj_ file: `H = ...`.

2.
  ```
  generate_H_int(; parameters::Dict)
  ```
  Generates the operator `H_int` according to the definition provided in the _qobj_ file: `H_{int} = ...`.

3.
  ```
  generate_n(i; parameters::Dict)
  ```
  Generates the operator `n` with index $i$ according to the definition provided in the _qobj_ file: either `n_i = ...` or `n_[i] = ...`.

`parameters` has to contain every parameter that was defined up to the definition of `SYMBOLE`.

## OperatorContainer
Container that stores every operator defined in the _qobj_ file. Example
```
struct OperatorContainer
  H
  H_{int}
  n
end
```
is generated by a _qobj_ file containing the definitions for `H`, `H_{int}` and `n`.


## generateSystem

```
generateSystem(; parameters::Dict)
```
Generates every available operator and stores them in an `OperatorContainer:
```
operators = generateSystem(...)
H  = operators.H
n1 = operators.n(1)
```
for a _qobj_ file containing
```
H   = ...
n_i = ...
```
`parameters` has to contain every parameter specified in the _qobj_ file.
